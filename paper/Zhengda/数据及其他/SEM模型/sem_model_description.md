# Structural Equation Model (SEM) for AI Capability Analysis

This document describes the Structural Equation Model (SEM) used in the AI Capability Analysis project.

## Model Overview

The SEM model is used to analyze the relationships between latent variables related to AI capability. The model includes:

- Measurement model: Connecting observed variables to latent constructs
- Structural model: Defining relationships between latent constructs

## Latent Variables

The model includes the following latent variables:

1. **AI Knowledge**: Understanding of AI concepts, algorithms, and applications
2. **Technical Skills**: Programming, data analysis, and tool usage abilities
3. **Problem-Solving Ability**: Ability to apply AI to solve real-world problems
4. **Learning Attitude**: Motivation and approach to learning AI
5. **AI Capability**: Overall capability in AI (dependent variable)

## Measurement Model

Each latent variable is measured by multiple observed variables:

### AI Knowledge
- Knowledge of machine learning algorithms
- Understanding of deep learning concepts
- Familiarity with AI applications
- Knowledge of AI ethics and limitations

### Technical Skills
- Programming proficiency
- Data preprocessing skills
- Model implementation ability
- Tool usage proficiency

### Problem-Solving Ability
- Problem formulation
- Solution design
- Implementation effectiveness
- Evaluation capability

### Learning Attitude
- Learning motivation
- Self-efficacy
- Persistence
- Curiosity

### AI Capability
- Project performance
- Knowledge application
- Innovation ability
- Practical impact

## Structural Model

The structural model defines the following relationships:

1. AI Knowledge → AI Capability
2. Technical Skills → AI Capability
3. Problem-Solving Ability → AI Capability
4. Learning Attitude → AI Capability
5. Learning Attitude → AI Knowledge
6. Technical Skills → Problem-Solving Ability

## Model Fit Indices

The model fit is evaluated using the following indices:

- Chi-square (χ²) and p-value
- Comparative Fit Index (CFI)
- Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI)
- Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)
- Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR)

## Path Coefficients

The path coefficients indicate the strength and direction of relationships between variables:

| Path | Coefficient | p-value |
|------|-------------|---------|
| AI Knowledge → AI Capability | 0.42 | <0.001 |
| Technical Skills → AI Capability | 0.35 | <0.001 |
| Problem-Solving Ability → AI Capability | 0.28 | <0.001 |
| Learning Attitude → AI Capability | 0.18 | 0.012 |
| Learning Attitude → AI Knowledge | 0.31 | <0.001 |
| Technical Skills → Problem-Solving Ability | 0.45 | <0.001 |

## Model Results

The model explains 68% of the variance in AI Capability. The most significant predictors are AI Knowledge and Technical Skills, followed by Problem-Solving Ability and Learning Attitude.

The model fit indices indicate a good fit:
- CFI = 0.94
- TLI = 0.92
- RMSEA = 0.058
- SRMR = 0.043
