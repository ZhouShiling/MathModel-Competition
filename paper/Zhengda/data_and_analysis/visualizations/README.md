# AI Capability Analysis Visualizations

This directory contains visualizations and figures for the AI Capability Analysis project.

## Contents

### Workflow Diagrams

- `research_workflow.png`: Overall research methodology workflow
- `survey_workflow.png`: Survey design and implementation workflow

### Word Clouds

Word clouds generated from text analysis of open-ended survey responses, showing:
- Key concepts related to AI capability
- Frequently mentioned skills and technologies
- Common challenges in AI learning

### Data Distribution and Correlation Analysis

- Histograms showing the distribution of key variables
- Correlation matrices visualizing relationships between variables
- Scatter plots showing bivariate relationships
- Box plots showing group comparisons

### Model Visualizations

- SEM model path diagrams
- Decision tree visualizations
- Feature importance plots for various models
- SHAP value plots showing feature contributions
- Residual plots for model diagnostics
- Prediction vs. actual plots for model evaluation

## Usage

These visualizations are referenced in the main paper and provide visual support for the findings and methodology. They can be used to:

1. Understand the research design and workflow
2. Visualize the distribution and relationships in the data
3. Interpret model results and feature importance
4. Compare the performance of different models

## File Formats

Visualizations are provided in PNG format for high-quality reproduction in the paper and presentations.
